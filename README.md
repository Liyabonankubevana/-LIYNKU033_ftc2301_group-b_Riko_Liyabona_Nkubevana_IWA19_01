# BRIEF:


As a junior JavaScript developer, you have been approached by a small startup called Book Connect. They run a social media platform specifically targeted at book enthusiasts. A basic version of the product was created by another freelance developer.

 

The team was extremely impressed by their HTML and CSS code. However, it eventually became clear that the developer was not entirely honest about their competency with JavaScript. While the client is happy with the current HTML and CSS, they have asked you to review the existing JavaScript code. Currently, it throws several errors preventing the code from even running. You will have to fix all critical issues, as well as do a full audit of the existing code. The goal is to highlight areas where improvements can be made to performance, readability and future maintainability. The client has provided you with prioritised user stories by means of the current backlog. These user stories express the product behaviour as intended, and the app will not be considered as fixed unless all these user stories are met.

 

While you understand that the task will be challenging and frustrating at times, you know that this is a fantastic opportunity for you to gain experience as a junior developer. You will be able to showcase your skills and demonstrate your ability to troubleshoot and improve existing code. They have asked you to spend a week digging into the codebase and compile your recommendations into a slideshow to be presented to the team at the end of the week.

 

They have provided you with a link to the following GitHub repository.



Please note that you should not make a pull request or attempt to make any changes on GitHub until you have presented your recommendations to the rest of the team.

User Stories:

As a user, I want to view a list of book previews, by title and author, so that I can discover new books to read.

As a user, I want an image associated with all book previews so that I can recognize a book by the cover even if I forgot the name.

As a user, I want to have the option of reading a summary of the book so that I can decide whether I want to read it.

As a user, I want to have the option of seeing the date that a book was published so that I can determine how easy it is to obtain second-hand.

As a user, I want to find books based on specific text phrases so that I donâ€™t need to remember the entire title of a book.

As a user, I want to filter books by author so that I can find books to read by authors that I enjoy.

As a user, I want to filter books by genre so that I can find books to read in genres that I enjoy.

As a user, I want to toggle between dark and light modes so that I can use the app comfortably at night.
